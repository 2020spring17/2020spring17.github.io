			 What is Web Accessibility?</a></h2>
	<p>Web Accessibility is the "inclusive practice" in making sure that everyone has access to the internet regardless of disability.</p>

	<a href="https://www.iweb.co.uk/2018/04/web-accessibility-standards/">Why is Web Accessibility Important?</a></h2>
	<p>Web Accessibility is important because it allows those with auditory, neurological, physical, speech, visual, and many more disabilites access to the internet. Everyone should have the ability to use the interent and these features can help achieve that. This is important because roughly 20% of the U.S. population has a disability and using the features of web accessibility can allow more people to enjoy your website.</p>

	<a href="https://www.afb.org/blindness-and-low-vision/using-technology/assistive-technology-products/screen-readers">What is a Screen Reader?</a></h2>
	<p>An application that can be added to any website to help those which are visually impared. It does this in two forms, either in speech or braile. Braile can be used for those who are deaf and blind and Text To Speech can be helpful for those who just have a visual imparment. A screen reader is an important feature to have on your webpage.  </p>

	<a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/k/keyboard.htm">What is a Key Board Input?</a></h2>
	<p>If someone is uncapble of using a mouse, the website must be functional using the keyboard. This can be done through a combination of keys to mimic the function of a mouse. Wheteher it is temporry or life long, there are many people who are incapble of controling a mouse so adding this feature to your webvpage allows many more people to have access to it.</p>

		   href="https://moz.com/learn/seo/alt-text">What is Alternate Text for Images?</a></h2>
	<p>If someone is unable to see then alternate text for images is needed. This text allows people who can't see the image to get a descrption of it so they can understand what is going on with the website. This is important because about 1.3 million americans over that age of 40 are legally blind. By allowing this group of peole access to your website, not only does it help them but it helps you.</p>
