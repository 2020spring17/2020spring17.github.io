<h1>Showcases</h1>
<p>Showcases are a great way to stand out to coaches individually. There are all sorts of showcases that cater to the top players in the nation as well as your average player who wants to play some type of college lacrosse. The way most showcases work is you individually register, apply, or get an invitation to these showcases. The higher the level of showcase, the harder it is to get it and the better the coaches that will be watching. Playing for a high level club or school can increase chances of the opportunity to play in the invite only events.

It is important to rank the priority of each event and make sure you are going to the most valuable one for you. Every showcase claims they are the best in the country but here is a list of elite level events.

Fall Showcase:
Inside Lacrosse Prospect Day
Igloo Elite 80
NXT Philly Showcase

Winter:
Future Phenoms
NLF Futures

Summer:
Maverik Showtime
Adrenaline Black Card
Under Armour Underclass All America
National All Star Games</p>
