<h1 id="top">Discovering Colleges Jigsaw Activity</h1>
	
<p>In this “Jigsaw” activity you will work in a group of five to six students. Each individual member of the group will become an expert on one of the colleges listed down below. After you research your college, you will present your findings to your group and each member can choose which one they like most.</p>
<h2>Follow these directions for a successful activity:</h2>
	

 <ul>

<li>Divide students into 5 or 6 person jigsaw groups.</li>
<li>Each student will be assigned a random number 1 to 5.</li>
<li>Each student will research the corresponding college with their given number.</li>
<li>Each student will research and become an “expert” on the college through the links given.</li>
<li>Each student will present their findings and will educate students on different types of higher education available to them after highschool. </li>
</ul> 

<p>Important things for students to look at are the academics programs, tuition, acceptance rate, financial aid program, sports, social life, and all of the other things that come with college.</p>
