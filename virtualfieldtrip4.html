<p> Prospect days are very different from the other two types of events. These events are for those interested in a specific college. You will only be watched and scouted by one individual college at their campus. You will likely be playing with a similar level of kids to the college but there may be some better/worse as prospect days are open registration. These are a much more affordable option as you can go to a handful of these for the price of one elite showcase. These are a must for anyone looking to play at the next level, it allows coaches who may have scouted you at other events to see your interest in their school as well as coach you and see how you react personally.</p>
