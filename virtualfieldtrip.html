<p> Greetings everyone! Welcome to a virtual field trip that will take you through everything you need to know about summer lacrosse. I have decided to take you all on this field trip as playing in these events and knowing this information is how you get recruited to play at the NCAA division 1, 2, or 3 level. there has been great uncertainty about if there will be a summer lacrosse season, but regardless knowing this information is vital if you wish to play at the next level. </p>
<p>During this Field Trip you will learn about the top events, different types of events, as well as other tips and tricks to get you recruited. But it’s important to remember that if you don’t put the work in by yourself going to these events will mean nothing if you don’t play well. </p>
