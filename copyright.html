	<div><h1> Copyright For Students</h1>
  <p><br>Copyright is a very important subject for students. It can be the matter between a 100 and a 0 on that big essay they have been working on for months.<br>

<br>A lot of students break the laws of copyright without even knowing them and some things that are tolerated in high school may not be in college so it is important to be educated on this subject.<br>

<br>Essays take a lot of work. As students get older teachers ask for more, higher quality work than in years past. It may seem really easy to copy someone else's work and take credit for that on your own but is important to understand why you shouldn’t do that and the consequences that come with that decision.<br> </p>
