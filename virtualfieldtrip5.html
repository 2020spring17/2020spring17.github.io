<h1>Contacting Coaches</h1>
<p>Coaches can not contact you until September 1st of your Junior year. Although they can not contact you, a majority of their scouting will be down the Fall/Summer before your Junior year. This means that although coaches can not directly contact you back it is important to reach out with a little about yourself as well as academic standings and your upcoming schedule and team so they can scout you. Coaches are not going to scout every player they believe can play so it is up to that player to show their interest.</p>
