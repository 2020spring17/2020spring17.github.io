  <h4 class= "ruleone">Watch grammar and errors like punctuation and spelling</h4>
  <p> Look professional, proof read and consider downloading an effective grammar and spell checker. </p>
  <h4 class= "ruletwo">Avoid talking pointlessly in emails</h4>
  <p> It’s not text or social media, emails should serve a purpose. Double check your emails can't be conveyed over a text message.</p>
  <h4 class= "rulethree">Choose a subject with purpose</h4>
  <p>The subject is the first thing the receiver sees, give them a reason to open the email. Make sure the subject is a quick phrase explaining what will be in the email. </p>
  <h4 class= "rulefour">Keep emails organized</h4>
  <p>Delete old emails and avoid signing up for spam mail. Although it can be hard to resist signing up for an email list for 10%off an online purpose, it can help youre inbox from overflowing with junk. </p>
  <h4 class= "rulefive">Reply to emails quickly</h4>
  <p> Don’t keep the others waiting. It is common courtesy to reply punctually.</p>
  <h4 class= "rulesix">Watch your tone</h4>
  <p>Tone can’t be shown through text so watch out for your tone. Sarcasm can especially come off as rude.</p>
  <h4 class= "ruleseven">Use a professional email address</h4>
  <p>Don’t be embarrassed to give a significant person your email address. Include your name or an abbrevation of it and maybe a number important to you. Avoid emails that the reciver expects a kids first email to be. </p>
  <h4 class= "ruleeight">Use appropriate salutations</h4>
  <p>If it’s a friend don’t be afraid to be more creative, but from, sincerly, or regards is always a good way to go. If emailing for school or work stick to professional closings to your emails. </p>
