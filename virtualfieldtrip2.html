<p>One of the best ways to help with general recruiting, development, and connections is within a club team. There are a lot of club teams out there from beginner to elite level. It’s important to gage what club team you play for with what level you want to play at in college. Obviously the best teams will play in the best tournaments and be watched by the best coaches. This is the same for medicare and lower level teams. 

The way these teams work is each team has their own respective tryouts and select their teams. A great majority of these elite teams are along the East Coast, but there are still a handful of teams that play at the highest level from the Midwest and West Coast. After this tryout process the club program selects their team and they have a handful of practices and tournaments in the Fall and Summer. The fall tournaments take place in November and Summer in June, July, and sometimes the first week of August.

There are also club teams that play in one elite tournament and this is a team that those kids who play on already elite teams can come together and gain more exposure. 

While everyone wants to win, the point of these tournaments is for the players to be seen, develop, and get recruited.

Some elite level tournaments that take place in the fall include: 
Igloo Team Invitational
Big 4 Champions League Fall
Elite Fall Invitational
NAL Lacrosse Invitational
NLF Fall
And more...

Some summer elite tournaments include:
NLF Opening Weekend
Adrenaline Platinum Cup
Big 4 Champions League
NAL Tournament
Crab Feast
Naptown National Challenge
